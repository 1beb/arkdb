Dear CRAN maintainers,

Changes in this release are described in NEWS.md
Thanks!

Note that winbuilder will always throw a NOTE on this package due to the continued
use (as SUGGESTED only) of a CRAN package that is not in the standard repositories.  

winbuilder may also show a NOTE regarding a possible 304 ("Not Modified") code on
https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values, the 
canonical IANA link defining this popular media-type format.  I do not believe there
is a preferable link here, but if the 304 code is problematic to CRAN maintainers,
I would be willing to merely remove the hyperlink and provide the URL only in 
plain text.  Just advise on your preference.


Carl
