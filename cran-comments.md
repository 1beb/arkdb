Dear CRAN maintainers,

This release avoids the use of utils::askYesNo in order to maintain
greater backwards compatibility with R versions prior to 3.5.0


## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
