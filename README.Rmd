# arkdb

The goal of arkdb is to provide a convienent way to move data from large compressed text files (tsv, csv, etc) into any DBI-compliant database connection (e.g. MYSQL, Postgres, SQLite, see [DBI](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/)), and move tables out of such databases into text files. 

## Installation

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
